JavaScript Warm-Up
This repository contains a set of exercises designed to practice basic JavaScript concepts. The tasks range from printing strings to creating simple functions. The goal of this project is to help you get comfortable with JavaScript syntax and basic functionality, focusing on concepts such as variable declarations, loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

Tasks Overview
0. First Constant, First Print
Write a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing" using a constant variable.

File: 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

Goal: Create a constant called myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing" and print it using console.log().

1. 3 Languages
Write a script that prints 3 lines:

"C is fun"

"Python is cool"

"JavaScript is amazing"

File: 1-multi_languages.js

Goal: Use console.log() to print the specified strings in the correct order.

2. Arguments
Write a script that prints a message depending on the number of arguments passed.

File: 2-arguments.js

Goal:

If no arguments are passed, print "No argument".

If one argument is passed, print "Argument found".

If more than one argument is passed, print "Arguments found".

3. Value of My Argument
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it. If no arguments are passed, print "No argument".

File: 3-value_argument.js

Goal: Use console.log() to print the first argument or print a default message if no argument is passed.

4. Create a Sentence
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it in the following format: <arg1> is <arg2>.

File: 4-concat.js

Goal: Ensure the format is maintained and handle undefined values correctly.

5. An Integer
Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer. Otherwise, print "Not a number".

File: 5-to_integer.js

Goal: Handle cases where the first argument is not a valid number and print appropriate messages.

6. Loop to Languages
Write a script that prints the same three lines (like task 1) using an array of strings and a loop.

File: 6-multi_languages_loop.js

Goal: Use a loop (for, while) to print the array of languages.

7. I Love C
Write a script that prints "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument passed to the script.

File: 7-multi_c.js

Goal: Ensure the correct number of repetitions, and handle the edge case where no or an invalid argument is passed.

8. Square
Write a script that prints a square using the character X. The first argument is the size of the square.

File: 8-square.js

Goal: Print a square based on the input size and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

9. Add
Write a script that prints the addition of two integers passed as arguments.

File: 9-add.js

Goal: Create a function add(a, b) that returns the sum of a and b, and print the result.

10. Factorial
Write a script that computes and prints the factorial of a number passed as an argument.

File: 10-factorial.js

Goal: Implement recursion to compute the factorial and handle edge cases where the argument is NaN.

11. Second Biggest!
Write a script that searches for the second-biggest integer in the list of arguments.

File: 11-second_biggest.js

Goal: Sort the arguments and return the second-largest integer, or 0 if no valid arguments are provided.

12. Object
Write a script that updates an object to replace the value of 12 with 89.

File: 12-object.js

Goal: Modify the object and print the updated version.

13. Add File
Write a function that returns the sum of two integers, and make it visible from outside the file.

File: 13-add.js

Goal: Export the add function to be used in other scripts.
