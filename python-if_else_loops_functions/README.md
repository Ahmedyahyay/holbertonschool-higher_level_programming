Project Overview
This repository contains solutions for various tasks within the Python programming language, focusing on control flow, loops, and functions. These tasks are intended to help users practice Python's basic structures and improve their understanding of writing simple programs that solve problems. Each task presents a different challenge related to Python's control flow mechanisms, with the goal of helping users develop their skills.

Task Breakdown
0. Positive Anything Is Better Than Negative Nothing
Description: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

File: 0-positive_or_negative.py

1. The Last Digit
Description: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints the last digit of the number. The program also outputs whether the last digit is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 but not 0.

File: 1-last_digit.py

2. Alphabet Game
Description: Prints the lowercase alphabet (ASCII values) without following a new line, using one loop and one print function.

File: 2-print_alphabet.py

3. Alphabet Soup (Excluding q and e)
Description: Prints all lowercase alphabet letters except 'q' and 'e', using one loop and one print function.

File: 3-print_alphabt.py

4. Hexadecimal Printing
Description: Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats, using one loop and one print function.

File: 4-print_hexa.py

5. 00...99
Description: Prints numbers from 0 to 99, with two digits, separated by commas and spaces. The last number is followed by a new line.

File: 5-print_comb2.py

6. Inventing Combinations
Description: Prints all possible different combinations of two digits, where numbers must be in ascending order and separated by a comma and space.

File: 6-print_comb3.py

7. Islower Function
Description: This function checks whether a given character is lowercase.

Prototype: def islower(c):

File: 7-islower.py

8. Uppercase Function
Description: This function prints a given string in uppercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: def uppercase(str):

File: 8-uppercase.py

9. Last Digit Function
Description: This function prints the last digit of a given number.

Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):

File: 9-print_last_digit.py

10. Addition Function
Description: This function adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: def add(a, b):

File: 10-add.py

11. Power Function
Description: This function computes a raised to the power of b and returns the result.

Prototype: def pow(a, b):

File: 11-pow.py

12. FizzBuzz Function
Description: Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

File: 12-fizzbuzz.py
